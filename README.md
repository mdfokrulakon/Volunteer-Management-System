Volunteer Management System (Oracle SQL)

This project is a comprehensive **Volunteer Management System** developed using Oracle SQL. It supports managing volunteers, their skills and interests, beneficiary organizations, and service requests.
The schema includes robust relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity across entities like volunteers, cities, skills, interests, and requests.

Key features:

* Detailed table structures with `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `CHECK` constraints.
* Data population with realistic entries for volunteers, skills, cities, and requests.
* Advanced SQL views for analytics, including volunteer skills, interests, age groups, travel readiness, request fulfillment, and participation summaries.
* Efficient volunteer-request matching based on skill sets and location.

This system can be used by NGOs, disaster relief organizations, or any volunteer-based operation for planning, monitoring, and decision-making.
To get started, run the SQL scripts in an Oracle-compatible environment. Make sure to execute `DROP TABLE` commands first to avoid duplication.
